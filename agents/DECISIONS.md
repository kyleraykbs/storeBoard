## [2026-10-06] Config model: peers → groups → folders, local mounts
- Decision: config declares `peers` (name → host:port endpoints), `groups`
  (peer membership + folders, each folder with an optional default mount),
  and `mounts` (this machine's per-folder override of a group folder's
  mount). Effective mount: local override → group default →
  `<dataDir>/mounts/<name>`. This machine names itself with `peer`
  (hostname fallback only while no groups are declared). Folder names are
  global across groups; every group must include this peer; endpoints must
  parse as host:port. All state lives under the one `dataDir`.
- Why: user direction — folders belong to groups of peers, each peer picks
  its own local mountpoint, one storage directory owns everything.
- Reversible: yes (pre-release; configVersion stays 1)
